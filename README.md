# Next.js SaaS Starter

This is a starter template for building a SaaS application using **Next.js** with support for authentication, Stripe integration for payments, and a dashboard for logged-in users.

[![Made with Prisma](http://made-with.prisma.io/dark.svg)](https://prisma.io)

## 🚀 Project Refactor and Upgrade 

### 🔐 Integration of `auth.js` for Authentication
- **Seamless Login Experience**: By integrating `auth.js`, we have implemented a more natural and intuitive login flow. Users can now easily log in using third-party providers (e.g., Google, GitHub), significantly improving the user experience.
- **Multiple Authentication Methods**: `auth.js` offers flexible authentication mechanisms, supporting OAuth, Email/Password, and more, catering to diverse user needs.

### 🗄️ Adoption of `Prisma` as the ORM Tool
- **Multi-Database Support**: With the introduction of `Prisma`, the project now supports both `SQLite` and `PostgreSQL`, allowing developers to choose the database that best fits their requirements.
- **Type-Safe Database Operations**: `Prisma` provides robust type safety, reducing errors in database operations and boosting development efficiency.
- **Simplified Database Migrations**: `Prisma`'s migration tools make database schema changes more straightforward and manageable.

### 🧩 Optimized Code Structure and Logic
- **Clearer Code Responsibilities**: We have reorganized the codebase to ensure each module and function has a clear and single responsibility, making the code easier to understand and maintain.
- **Simplified Complex Logic**: Through refactoring, we have streamlined complex business logic, resulting in cleaner and more extensible code.
- **Improved Readability**: The readability of the code has been significantly enhanced, allowing new developers to onboard and contribute more quickly.

### 🌐 i18n 
- Integrated i18n for localized messages, allowing users to switch languages at runtime.
 

## Features

- Marketing landing page (`/`) with animated Terminal element
- Pricing page (`/pricing`) which connects to Stripe Checkout
- Dashboard pages with CRUD operations on users/teams
- Basic RBAC with Owner and Member roles
- Subscription management with Stripe Customer Portal
- Authentication with Next-auth (Email/Password + OAuth providers)
- Global middleware to protect logged-in routes
- Local middleware to protect Server Actions or validate Zod schemas
- Activity logging system for any user events

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- **Database**: [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- **ORM**: [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
- **Authentication**: [Next-auth](https://next-auth.js.org/)
- **Payments**: [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)
- **UI Library**: [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nextjs/saas-starter
cd saas-starter
pnpm install
```

## Running Locally

1. Copy the environment variables template:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Update the `.env` file with your:
   - Database connection string
   - Next-auth configuration (NEXTAUTH_SECRET, optional OAuth providers)
   - Stripe keys

3. Run database migrations:
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

4. Seed the database with a default user and team:
```bash
npx prisma db seed
```

This will create:
- User: `test@test.com`
- Password: `admin123`

5. Start the development server:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

For Stripe webhooks during development:
```bash
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook
```

## Authentication Configuration

The template comes pre-configured with:
- Email/password authentication
- Session management with JWT
- Protected API routes using Next-auth middleware

To enable OAuth providers:
1. Add your credentials to `.env`
```env
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_github_id
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_github_secret
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_secret
```
2. Update `src/auth/options.ts` to include the providers

## Testing Payments

Use Stripe test card:
- **Card**: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- **Date**: Any future date
- **CVC**: Any 3 digits

## Production Deployment

### Vercel Deployment
1. Push your code to a Git repository
2. Connect to Vercel and deploy
3. Add environment variables in Vercel settings:
```env
DATABASE_URL=your_production_db_url
AUTH_SECRET=your_random_secret  # generate with: openssl rand -base64 32
AUTH_URL=https://yourdomain.com
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_live_key
```

### Database Setup
Create a production PostgreSQL database and connect it through Prisma:
```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### Stripe Webhooks
1. Create production webhook in Stripe Dashboard
2. Set endpoint to: `https://yourdomain.com/api/stripe/webhook`
3. Add webhook secret to `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in Vercel

## Key Changes from Original
- Replaced Drizzle ORM with Prisma migrations and schema
- Switched custom JWT auth to Next-auth implementation
- Updated database seed script to use Prisma client
- Added Next-auth middleware for route protection
- Simplified session management with built-in Next-auth methods
 


 ## WIP
 - [x] update user context-> next-auth
 - [ ] update 3rd oauth login -> invite/newUser logic
